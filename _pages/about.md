I am a Lecturer in Data Science, AI and Modelling at the [University of Hull](https://www.hull.ac.uk/staff-directory/matishalin-patel). My research is primarily on the interface between mathematical and computational modelling and evolutionary theory. I work on the evolution of symbiosis and the maintenance of cooperation between species. I am also developing tools to understand evolution using artificial life simulations. 

I was previously a Researcher at the Centre for the Future of Intelligence as part of the [Kinds of Intelligence project](http://lcfi.ac.uk/projects/kinds-of-intelligence/) and the [Animal-AI Olympics group](http://lcfi.ac.uk/projects/kinds-of-intelligence/animalaiolympics/). I continue to work on applying evolutionary theory to understanding the evolution of intelligence in the natural world and applying those insights to developing animal-like artificial intelligences.

I was previously a Research Associate with [Prof. Rufus Johnstone](https://www.zoo.cam.ac.uk/directory/rufus-johnstone) at the University of Cambridge. Where I worked on working on models for intergroup conflict in [Banded Mongooses](http://socialisresearch.org/about-the-banded-mongoose-project/).
My DPhil was undertaken at Oxford University at the [West Group](http://zoo-web02.zoo.ox.ac.uk/group/west/). My thesis focused on social evolutionary theory of altruistic and spiteful traits. 

I am especially interested in how Deep Learning algorithms can be used as a study system for evolutionary theory as well as a computational tool for biology. My current focus in this area is on Reinforcement Learning and NEAT and hyperNEAT implementations of architecture search.
